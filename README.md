# Digital Design 1- Quine-McClusky Logic Minimization 
Designed to use the Quine-McClusky minimization method to optain the Prime Implicants and Essential Prime Implicants of any Boolean function (up to 20 bits) using
its minterms and don't care terms.

## Directions

First, you will need to create a text file that contains the number of variables, minterms, and don't care terms. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

- Create the following file: `input.txt`.

- Inside this file, the first line of the file should contain a single number that describes the number of variables in the function.

- The second line should contain a set of numbers that represent the minterms, separated by commas.

- The third and final line should contain the don't care terms (if any), also separated by commas.

### Minimum Requirements
